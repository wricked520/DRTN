## Generation
First, compile the extension modules.
```
cd utils/cython
python3 setup.py build_ext -i
```
To generate results using a trained model, use
```
python3 main.py -f samples/test.jpg 
```
## Evaluation
To eval our DRTN , use
```
python benchmark.py
```
## Training
To train our DRTN, use
```
cd training
bash train_DRTN.sh
```
